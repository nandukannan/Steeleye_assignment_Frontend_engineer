React Component Code Review

# 1.
Explain what the simple List component does.
Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript
we will use the map() function for traversing the list element, and for updates, we enclosed them between curly braces {}. Finally, we assign the array elements to listItems. Now, include this new list inside <ul> </ul> elements and render it to the DOM.

# 2.
What problems / warnings are there with code?

# 3.
Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.
